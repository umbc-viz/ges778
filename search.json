    "section": "Documenting code",
    "text": "Documenting code\nOne of the most important things you can do as a programmer is to document your code. This can be hard to do well, but it’s essential to making sure your code is clear and accountable and that your work can be reproduced or repurposed. (If you’ve followed the “replicability crisis” in the sciences over the past decade or so, you’ve seen what can go very wrong when your work isn’t documented accurately for yourself and others!)\nA common suggestion is to write your code assuming you’ll come back to it in 6 months and need to be able to pick up where you left off. I usually also assume a coworker or colleague will need to rerun or reuse my code, so even if I’m doing something that I’ll remember 6 months from now, they might not know what things mean. It also gets me out of spending unnecessary amounts of time walking interns through an analysis if I can say, “I tried to document everything really well, so read through it, run all the code, and let me know if you need help after that.” Documenting code also helps ease the transition into package development, which requires a lot of documentation.\nI don’t document everything—plenty of my work is routine and straightforward enough—but some of the things I try to always take note of:\n\nAny sort of analysis or process that’s out of the ordinary or complex. Don’t assume you’ll remember later why you used a new approach.\nAnything I know someone else will need to be able to reference. Sometimes I do EDA on something that a coworker will then finish up or need to write about. I need to make sure they can do that accurately.\nOutside sources that don’t come from that specific project. If your project is contained within a set of folders, and you’ve copied data in from some other project, make a note of where it comes from so if you need to update it you know where to get it from.\nDecision-making that you might need to keep track of or argue for later. e.g. a comparison of categories between datasets with a note that says “these categories changed significantly since the previous data collection” will be helpful when someone asks why you didn’t include trends in an analysis.\nReferences. If I came up with some code based on a Stack Overflow post or a blog post somewhere, or I’m building off of someone else’s methodology, I’ll usually include a link in my comments.\n\nThis also applies to simple things like organizing your projects. If you have a bunch of folders called things like “data analysis 1” and they all contain a jumble of different notebooks and scripts for different purposes, and the scripts are all called “analysis_of_stuff.R”, you’re going to lose things easily and not know how different pieces build on each other. Similarly, don’t spend time doing an analysis only to write your data out to a file called “data.csv” and a plot called “map.png”. This might seem obvious, but I’ve seen people do all of these things.\n\nExercises\nGoing back to your list for leaving the house, add notes for how you decide whether you’ll need something. For example, if your laptop is on your “sometimes” list, write down what decides that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrainstorm\n\n\n\n\nCash – if you’re going somewhere that doesn’t take cards / mobile\nSweater – weather / environment\nTea – sleepiness\nEarbuds – length of time out of house / time of day\nWork badge – going to office\nLaptop charger – if not already charged",

    "text": "Reusable code\nOne rule of thumb I’ve heard is that it’s fine to repeat your code to do the same thing twice, but if you need to do it a third time, you should write a function. It might mean taking a step back from what you’re working on at the moment, but it’s pretty much always worth the time. Alongside documenting your code in general, it’s important to document your functions—what they do, what the arguments mean, what types of values arguments can take. Try to your functions and their arguments in ways that make it clear what they mean as well.",

I have some projects that I rebuild once a year when new ACS data comes out, and I’ve got things down to where I can make one or two calls on the command line flagging the year as a variable, and all the data wrangling and analyses are ready to go. In fact, this site rebuilds from a frozen list of packages every time I push to GitHub, and if that build is successful, it publishes automatically.\nSome tools I use:\n\nGNU Make, the OG build tool\nSnakemake, like GNU Make but written in Python and designed for data analysis\nGitHub actions, including ones specifically for R\nDocker, build a small isolated environment for your projects, some designed for R\nPackage & environment managers: mamba or conda for Python, renv for R",

If we make a chart and it goes down to e.g. 10,000 that’s a sign that something weird might be happening. On the dependent axis, we have 2 categories of sex :-/ and 4 of education; if we end up with only 3 bars, or with 15 bars, something’s wrong.\n\nggplot(sex_x_edu, aes(x = edu, y = earn_q50))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThese scales make sense so far—I haven’t signaled that sex will be included here, or that we’re making a bar chart which is why the dependent axis doesn’t have to go down to 0.\n\nggplot(sex_x_edu, aes(x = edu, y = earn_q50)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependent scale has changed: it goes down to 0, which makes sense because now we have bars, but it goes up to 200,000, which is weird.\n\nggplot(sex_x_edu, aes(x = edu, y = earn_q50)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThis still includes both men and women, but sex isn’t assigned to any aesthetic, so bars just get stacked.

    "text": "Representing data\nSome of the ways we’ve talked about data visualization being misleading are intentional and malicious. That definitely happens, and how often you run into it might depend on your sources of information (Fox News, boardroom presentations, Congress, social media influencers…) but more often it’s just lack of skill and fluency.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeceptive coffee creamer\n\n\n\nWho’s in the data\nOne of the easiest things to mess up is the universe of your data. This is basically your denominator—who or what is included and used as the unit of analysis. I’ve most often found (and made, and corrected) this type of mistake with survey data, because it can be hard to know exactly who’s being asked every question.\nAn easy way to catch this is to read the fine print on your data sources, and to do it routinely because it might change. Some examples:\n\nBirth outcomes: for some measures, unit might be babies; for others, parent giving birth\nACS tables: several tables seem like they match, but one is by household and another is by person. Be especially mindful with tables related to children and family composition—these get messy. 1\nProxies: when I analyzed data on police stops, I tried to figure out a population to compare to. I didn’t have data on how many people in each census tract had a driver’s license, decennial data wasn’t out yet so I didn’t have reliable local counts of population 16 and up by race, so I just used population. It wasn’t ideal.\nRelationships: is a question being asked of parents, or of adults with a child in their household? These aren’t necessarily the same.\n\n1 This one is especially brain-melting: Ratio of Income to Poverty Level in the Past 12 Months by Nativity of Children Under 18 Years in Families and Subfamilies by Living Arrangements and Nativity of Parents. The universe is own children under 18 years in families and subfamilies for whom poverty status is determined.Another example: how would you make sense of this?\n\n\n\nShare of adults reporting having been unfairly stopped by police, Connecticut, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ncategory\ngroup\never_unfairly_stopped\nmultiple_times_3yr\n\n\n\n\nConnecticut\nTotal\nTotal\n15%\n29%\n\n\nConnecticut\nRace/Ethnicity\nWhite\n12%\n16%\n\n\nConnecticut\nRace/Ethnicity\nBlack\n25%\n40%\n\n\nConnecticut\nRace/Ethnicity\nLatino\n20%\n50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObscuring data\nWe’ve talked some about dealing with missing data, and often the solution to data-related problems is to get more of it. But sometimes it’s important to not be counted, or to not show everything. There are even times when it might be good to intentionally mess up the data (maybe this isn’t the role of the visualizer, however). 2 I would argue that hiding data when necessary should also be part of doing data analysis and viz responsibly. Some examples:\n2 The Census Bureau made the controversial decision to basically do this, via differential privacy. Wang (2021)\nWang, H. L. (2021). For The U.S. Census, Keeping Your Data Anonymous And Useful Is A Tricky Balance. NPR. https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/993247101/for-the-u-s-census-keeping-your-data-anonymous-and-useful-is-a-tricky-balance\n\nFilling period tracking apps with fake data after Roe v Wade was overturned\nNot adding citizenship to the census or other surveys; not asking about sexual orientation and gender identity. In theory these should both be fine, but in practice they may not be safe for people to disclose, or they could get misused.\nLeaving out parts of your data that could be stigmatizing or lead to misinformation\n\nAn example of this last point:\n\nMy organization’s survey asked a similar set of questions, but we chose not to release the question about getting COVID from the vaccine. The others are valid concerns; that one is misinformation that we didn’t want to repeat even with qualifiers.\n\n\nLack of a pattern\nSometimes the pattern you expect to find in a dataset isn’t there, and that’s okay. You want to go into your work with an open mind, rather than force the data into the story you want it to tell. I’m really into situations where the pattern you think you’re going to find isn’t there, and that’s the story—it might point to a disruption in the usual pattern.\n\n\nSay what you mean\n\nDon’t say “people of color” when you actually mean “Black people” or “Black and Latino people” or something else. This drives me crazy, and I’m sure I’ve done it as well. Sometimes because of small sample sizes or other limitations, you can’t break your data down further than white vs people of color. But if you can disaggregate further, do so, at least in the EDA process. This especially goes for data that deals with something that historically targeted e.g. Black people or indigenous people or some other group.\nAlong those same lines, don’t say BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) if you don’t actually have any data to show on indigenous people, or LGBT if you have no data on trans people.",

    "text": "Distributions\nWhen we visualize data, one of the most important decisions we make is what values exactly we’ll display. That’s because you usually can’t include every data point, so you’ll have to do some amount of summarizing. However, that means you’re losing a lot of information in the process. That’s a fine line you need to figure out how to walk, and like most things we’ve done so far, how you do that will depend on context, audience, and purpose. In my own work, I know I fall on the side of oversimplifying more often than I should.\nThe problem is that unless people have a background in statistics or other quantitative research-heavy fields, they probably aren’t used to hearing about ranges of data—let alone ways to describe distributions, like skew and kurtosis. So the chart types that are best for showing distributions or uncertainty are generally pretty technical.\nFor example, look at the range of median household incomes by county:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s already a wide range, but compare that to all their tracts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the counties in the Baltimore metro area, Howard County has a much higher overall median income than Baltimore city, yet there’s also a lot of overlapping values. Baltimore city has several tracts with pretty high incomes, but that fact gets washed out when we only look at summary values. Even just look at how different the income scales are!\nThink back to the wage gap data. When we just look at wages for men vs women, 1 we lose differences within and between those groups. Before we saw how median earnings increase with educational attainment, but women’s pay lags about one education level behind men’s pay. We’ll see other gaps when we look at earnings by sex and race/ethnicity.\n1 Speaking of distributions within data, there are gray areas in gender that aren’t captured by the Census.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide-by-side bars of race versus sex show much more of the range. When we talk about the wage gap as just men vs women, we miss the fact that white women have higher median earnings than Black or Latino men! 2\n2 We also miss gaps within those groups, such as disparities by ethnicity, origin, and immigration status. An intern I worked with a few years ago made this video looking at the wage gaps within Asian American groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike bars, dots don’t have to start at a 0 baseline, so we can zoom in on the actual range of the values. This view makes it easier to see that the gaps within white and Asian/Pacific Islander communities span about $20,000 each, but is nearly nonexistent for Black adults. (For charts like this, you’ll more often see the axes flipped and the groups ordered largest to smallest, or largest gap to smallest gap, but I’ll let you figure that out—take a look at forcats::fct_reorder.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\nJust like we can disaggregate the data into race vs sex, we can also tease apart the distributions within those groups. The wage gap data has not just medians, but also 20th, 25th, 75th, and 80th percentile values for every group.\nHere’s a bad chart of this data that just dumps all the data into a bunch of points.

    "text": "Uncertainty\nIt can be really hard to imagine or estimate uncertainty. We expect data to be exact, and it pretty much never is. Visualization can help explain this to people, but that can conflict with our usual desire to make our visualizations simple and quick to read. In fact, I dropped all the margins of error from the datasets in the justviz package when I made it, so I’m part of the problem.\nWilke’s chapter on uncertainty has some good examples of how to show uncertainty in terms of margin of error in a few different types of charts. At the same time, there are some arguments against using error bars like he’s done in some of the examples. One of the case study readings (Correll & Gleicher (2014)) finds that these can actually harm people’s ability to understand uncertainty.\n\nCorrell, M., & Gleicher, M. (2014). Error Bars Considered Harmful: Exploring Alternate Encodings for Mean and Error. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 20(12), 2142–2151. https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346298\nProbably the most famous and famously controversial attempt at visualizing uncertainty was the gauge chart the New York Times used on election night 2016. It was meant to show that the vote margins were in flux as counts came in, but the jittering effect was actually hard-coded into the visualization rather than based directly on tallies updating. People got extremely stressed and mad.\nFor working in ggplot, the ggdist package (Kay (2024)) has some good options for showing distributions and uncertainty. 3\n\nKay, M. (2024). Mjskay/ggdist. https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist\n3 ggdist::geom_dots or ggdist::geom_interval and its arguments could make a good replacement for the boxplot of median income above.4 I can never define margin of error properly, but here’s a good overview.To make up for dropping margins of error before, I made a new dataset that we’ll use here. It’s the same wages data by sex, education, and occupation group, and it includes margins of error at both the 90% and 95% confidence levels. 4 When I analyzed the wage data, it came from a subset of the ACS, so a sample of a sample. With survey data like this, you have to worry about having large enough sample sizes to get reliable estimates. So far we’ve used fairly large groups (women in Maryland with bachelor’s degrees, etc), but when we slice the data more, we start to get less reliable estimates.\nFor example, calculating median income of women in military occupations by education leaves us with some very small sample sizes, and some very large MOEs. Rule of thumb is usually that you need at least 30 observations in your sample for estimates to be useful; you might also want to set a minimum number of estimated counts.\n\nwages_moe &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"inputs/wages_sex_edu_occ.rds\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(occ_group = forcats::as_factor(occ_group) |&gt;\n           forcats::fct_relabel(stringr::str_replace, \",? \\\\band\\\\b\", \" &\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(lower_95 = earn_q50 - moe_95,\n         lower_90 = earn_q50 - moe_90,\n         upper_90 = earn_q50 + moe_90,\n         upper_95 = earn_q50 + moe_95)\n\nwages_moe |&gt;\n  filter(sex == \"Women\",\n         occ_group == \"Military Specific\") |&gt;\n  select(6:12)\n\n\n\n\n\nedu\ncount\nsample_n\nearn_q50\nse\nmoe_90\nmoe_95\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n2002\n92\n64738\n5916\n9731\n11595\n\n\nHigh school or less\n182\n14\n34600\n17175\n28250\n33662\n\n\nSome college or AA\n732\n28\n63586\n11043\n18164\n21644\n\n\nBachelors\n558\n27\n62580\n4182\n6879\n8197\n\n\nGraduate degree\n530\n23\n85000\n15611\n25678\n30597\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting that estimate for women in military occupations with a graduate degree would be silly: $85k ± $30k means that at a 95% confidence level, you’ve estimated the median to be between $55k and $115k, which tells you virtually nothing.\nError bars are one simple way to show the MOE. When we don’t split things up by education, and we look statewide, the MOEs aren’t so bad for most occupational groups (note which ones are pretty big, and for which genders).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we split by education, however, we get wider margins. Note also that we still have pretty wide distributions within occupation: what’s the difference between a healthcare job someone with a graduate degree has and one someone with at most a high school degree?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing to know about margins of error is that they can be used as a kind of crude approximation of statistical testing (t-tests, etc). For example, the margins of error for people with graduate degrees in production occupations overlap, so we shouldn’t say they differ by sex until we do formal testing. For service jobs, however, the MOEs don’t overlap, so that’s a safer bet (but not a replacement for tests of statistical significance).",

If you need more accuracy, you might convert the data into a time series (I like the tsibble package because it works well with dplyr) and fill in missing observations.

    "text": "At its essence, the aim of data visualization is to move data and its meaning(s) and context(s) from some origin (spreadsheets, observed phenomena, etc.) to a larger audience. It’s a spectrum of incredibly powerful tools for not just understanding and explaining facts, but also for shaping what those facts are and creating the narrative around them. By the end of this course, you will have thought through your role and responsibility in an evolving field, developed a set of best practices that is likely to continue to change, engaged with larger social currents toward your own goals, and strengthened your skills in R.\nBecause this is part of a professional studies program based on open source software and the ethos behind it, the course will be very hands-on and require everyone’s willingness to contribute and participate. Instead of tests and graded homework assignments, we’ll focus on practice, critique, and revision, building continuously on individual projects and shared tools. To some extent, the class structure will mimic a workplace, where you have projects with checkpoints and meetings to brainstorm and workshop your ideas, with time to work both in class and on your own at home.\nBecause data science and data visualization—and the software we use for both—change so quickly, a lot of the community’s discourse happens in less formal settings, such as blogs, social media, podcasts, and workshops, rather than just traditional academic journals and books. Our readings (defined loosely enough to include videos of talks, podcasts, and simply browsing through data visualization projects) will likewise fall along this spectrum, and you’ll have some flexibility in what you read and share.\nAbove all, I want this to be a course that is useful to you as you build a career of critical engagement with data. The schedule is intentionally loose so we can adjust based on skills we may want or need to build upon, and each student’s goals and interests.

Faculty and teaching assistants therefore required to report all known information regarding alleged conduct that may be a violation of the Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, even if a student discloses an experience that occurred before attending UMBC and/or an incident that only involves people not affiliated with UMBC.  Reports are required regardless of the amount of detail provided and even in instances where support has already been offered or received.\nWhile faculty members want to encourage you to share information related to your life experiences through discussion and written work, students should understand that faculty are required to report past and present sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, and gender discrimination that is shared with them to the Title IX Coordinator so that the University can inform students of their rights, resources, and support.  While you are encouraged to do so, you are not obligated to respond to outreach conducted as a result of a report to the Title IX Coordinator.\nIf you need to speak with someone in confidence, who does not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator, UMBC has a number of Confidential Resources available to support you: \nRetriever Integrated Health (Main Campus): 410-455-2472; Monday – Friday 8:30 a.m. – 5 p.m.; For After-Hours Support, Call 988.\nCenter for Counseling and Well-Being (Shady Grove Campus): 301-738-6273; Monday-Thursday 10:00a.m. – 7:00 p.m. and Friday 10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m. (virtual) Online Appointment Request Form\nPastoral Counseling via The Gathering Space for Spiritual Well-Being: 410-455-6795; i3b at umbc dot edu; Monday – Friday 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m.\n\n\nOther Resources\nWomen’s Center (open to students of all genders): 410-455-2714; womenscenter at umbc dot edu; Monday – Thursday 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. and Friday 10:00 a.m. – 4 p.m.\nShady Grove Student Resources, Maryland Resources, National Resources.\n\n\nChild Abuse and Neglect\nPlease note that Maryland law and UMBC policy require that faculty report all disclosures or suspicions of child abuse or neglect to the Department of Social Services and_/_or the police even if the person who experienced the abuse or neglect is now over 18.\n\n\n\nPregnant and Parenting Students\nUMBC’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination expressly prohibits all forms of discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, including pregnancy. Resources for pregnant, parenting and breastfeeding students are available through the University’s Office of Equity and Civil Rights.  Pregnant and parenting students are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator to discuss plans and ensure ongoing access to their academic program with respect to a leave of absence – returning following leave, or any other accommodation that may be needed related to pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, breastfeeding, and/or the early months of parenting.\nIn addition, students who are pregnant and have an impairment related to their pregnancy that qualifies as disability under the ADA may be entitled to accommodations through the Office of Student Disability Services.\n\n\nReligious Observances & Accommodations\nUMBC Policy provides that students should not be penalized because of observances of their religious beliefs, and that students shall be given an opportunity, whenever feasible, to make up within a reasonable time any academic assignment that is missed due to individual participation in religious observances. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor of any intended absences or requested modifications for religious observances in advance, and as early as possible. For questions or guidance regarding religious observances and accommodations, please contact the Office of Equity and Civil Rights at ecr at umbc dot edu.\n\n\nHate, Bias, Discrimination and Harassment\nUMBC values safety, cultural and ethnic diversity, social responsibility, lifelong learning, equity, and civic engagement.\nConsistent with these principles, UMBC Policy prohibits discrimination and harassment in its educational programs and activities or with respect to employment terms and conditions based on race, creed, color, religion, sex, gender, pregnancy, ancestry, age, gender identity or expression, national origin, veterans status, marital status, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or genetic information.\nStudents (and faculty and staff) who experience discrimination, harassment, hate, or bias based upon a protected status or who have such matters reported to them should use the online reporting/referral form to report discrimination, hate, or bias incidents. You may report incidents that happen to you anonymously. Please note that, if you report anonymously, the University’s ability to respond may be limited.\n\n\nUMBC Writing Center\nThe Academic Success Center offers free writing assistance through our Writing Center, which is located on the first floor of the Library. We also offer online and asynchronous tutoring. Writing tutors are students like you who receive ongoing training to stay up-to-date on the best tutoring techniques.

    "text": "Accessibility\nAfter talking about making responsible decisions in data visualization, it’s embarrassing to admit that accessibility has been a major oversight of mine, but it’s true, and it’s for no other reason than privilege. On a day-to-day basis I don’t have to think about whether learning or interacting with something will depend on my ability to see well, read complicated text, speak a certain language, navigate stimuli, process information, or access technology and resources. In fact, until last week I hadn’t even bothered writing alt texts for the charts in these notes; I’m going back and doing that now, but my hope for you all is that you start out your data viz careers being more mindful than I’ve been.\nFor the most part when we talk about accessibility, we mean this with respect to disabilities; in static data visualization, this mostly means visual impairments such as blindness, low vision, and colorblindness. If you go on to do interactive or web-based visualization, you’ll also need to think about things like navigation (access for keyboards and assistive devices vs clicking menus only) and animation (can be overstimulating or hard to process). 1\n1 Circa 2017, scrollytelling was very cool and people were very intense with it. I’ve noticed in recent years people have eased up. It can be disorienting for some readers. Webb (2018) convinced me to scrap my scrollytelling plans for some projects during that era.\nWebb, E. (2018). Your Interactive Makes Me Sick. https://source.opennews.org/articles/motion-sick/\nSome of the simplest tasks we can do for static data visualization are using colorblind-friendly palettes, writing alt-text descriptions, and maintaining high contrast ratios between backgrounds and text.\n\nColorblindness\nYou should generally assume your work will be read by at least a few colorblind readers (or people with color-vision deficiency, CVD) and plan your color palettes accordingly. Wilke mentions this as a reason for redundant coding as well, so you’re not relying on color alone to differentiate values. 2\n2 Something that blew my mind is in Frank Elavsky’s interview on PolicyViz. He acknowledges that awareness of CVD has become the norm in data viz, but that it actually predominantly affects white men, and that it shouldn’t be too surprising that that is often the only accommodation made in a field where white men are overrepresented.The most common form of CVD is what’s called red-green colorblindness. Many common R color palettes are colorblind-friendly, and some tools will help you tell whether a palette is or not, or for which color deficiencies they are legible.\nSome code examples:\n\n# Not all Color Brewer palettes are CVD-friendly, but you can filter in the R package\n# or on the website for ones that are\nRColorBrewer::display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Same goes for Carto Colors\nrcartocolor::display_carto_all(colorblind_friendly = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# All Viridis palettes are designed to be CVD-friendly\n# use them with e.g. ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c()\ncolorspace::swatchplot(viridisLite::viridis(n = 9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Okabe-Ito is built into R and based on lots of research into CVD\ncolorspace::swatchplot(palette.colors(n = 9, palette = \"Okabe-Ito\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also a lot of tools to help you simulate different types of CVD. This is particularly useful for diverging palettes, which can be hard to make accessible.\n\nset.seed(1)\ncvd_data &lt;- data.frame(group = sample(letters[1:7], size = 200, replace = TRUE),\n                       value = rnorm(200))\ndiv_pal &lt;- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = 7, name = \"RdYlGn\")\n\np &lt;- ggplot(cvd_data, aes(x = value, fill = group)) +\n  geom_dotplot(method = \"histodot\", binpositions = \"all\", binwidth = 0.2)\n\np + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = div_pal) +\n  labs(title = \"Brewer palette RdYlGn\")\n\np + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = colorspace::deutan(div_pal)) +\n  labs(title = \"Deuteranomaly\")\n\np + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = colorspace::protan(div_pal)) +\n  labs(title = \"Protanomaly\")\n\np + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = colorspace::tritan(div_pal)) +\n  labs(title = \"Tritanomaly\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are lots of tools to do similar simulations, although many of them require you to have a graphic already saved to a file. An online one that’s good for developing and adjusting palettes is Viz Palette by Susie Lu; this one also accounts for the size of your geometries.\n\n\nViz Palette takes a set of space- or comma-separated colors as hex values. If you have a vector of colors, call\ncat(div_pal, sep = \" \")\nto get it all in one line that you only have to copy & paste once.\n\n\nAlt text\nAlt text is the text that’s displayed in place of, or alongside, and image online and in some types of documents (certain PDF versions, Microsoft Word, etc). If someone is using a screen reader, it will read this text aloud. This can be embedded in posts on most social media platforms as well, and is autogenerated on some (if you ever look at Facebook with a bad internet connection, you might see alt text until the images load.) As the designer of your visualizations, you’re in a unique position to write alt text, since you will have close knowledge of the data and what’s important about it.\nIncluding alt text in R:\n\nFor exporting ggplot charts, you can include alt text in labs(alt = \"\").\nIn Rmarkdown documents, you can include it as the fig.alt chunk option\nSimilar for Quarto documents: fig-alt\nWhen directly including images in Markdown, use ![fig-name](fig_path){fig-alt=\"Alt text goes here\"}\n\n\n\nContrast\nDifferent pieces of your visualization need to have enough contrast to be legible at different sizes, especially between text and its background. This comes up with labels like titles, but especially with direct labels. Generally your labels will be all white or all black (or slightly darker or lighter, respectively), so if you’re putting direct labels on several bars with different colors, make sure you have enough contrast across all of them.\nFor example, this palette starts out very dark and ends very light, so neither white nor black will be legible across all bars. Switching between label colors (light on the dark bars, dark on the light bars) can be distracting or imply something about the data that isn’t there, so it’s better to use a palette where all labels can be the same color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\n\n\nThe W3C recommends a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 for regular-sized text, and 3 for large text.

Twenty-two percent of US adults ages 16 to 74 are rated as having low literacy; in Maryland, this is 20% (National Center for Education Statistics, 2020). 3 So if you’re creating a visualization that needs to work for a general audience, you’ll want to keep your sentences short, language simple, and chart types pretty standard. Or, you can get more complex with the use of annotations or other guidance.\n\nNational Center for Education Statistics. (2020). Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). National Center for Education Statistics. https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/state-county-estimates.asp\n3 This program outlines definitions of “low literacy,” but in news stories and Wikipedia it’s being referred to as corresponding to a sixth grade reading level. I haven’t found anything directly connected to the program that corroborates that.\nExercise\nTest the reading level of the headlines you wrote using each of these tools:\n\nWordcalc: https://www.wordcalc.com/readability/\nHemingway: https://hemingwayapp.com/\n\nFor the versions of the headlines that you thought were at sixth grade level, what level were they actually? Try to get them to sixth grade or below. What revisions did you have to make to get there?\n\nIf you have access to decent AI tools, they might help with this also. I tried with Chat GPT (GPT-3.5) with mixed results. It came out to 5th grade in the end, but loses some of the memorability of “one in four.”\n\nUser Rewrite the following sentence to be at a US 6th grade reading level: “One in four Black adults, and one in five Latinos, have been unfairly stopped or harassed by police.”\nChatGPT “Police have unfairly stopped or harassed one out of every four Black adults, and one out of every five Latinos.”\nUser Based on the Flesch-Kincaid scale, that’s a 9.9 reading level\nChatGPT Here’s a revised sentence with a lower reading level:\n“Police have unfairly stopped or harassed one out of every four Black adults, and one out of every five Latinos.”\nThis should be around a 6th grade reading level according to the Flesch-Kincaid scale.\nUser That’s the same sentence\nChatGPT I apologize for the confusion.

There are 2 approaches to this with ggplot: using geoms (geom_text, geom_hline, etc) or annotation layers (annotate, annotation_custom). The main difference is that annotations aren’t mapped to data the way geoms are. Because of that, I almost only use geoms for annotations, and usually make a small data frame just for the data that goes into the annotations to avoid hard-coding too much.\nAn example from DataHaven’s most recent books: we wanted to explicitly put evictions into a policy context, so we marked off the end of the federal eviction moratorium and the prepandemic average count as a threshhold. Without those labeled lines, you could tell that there was an abrupt drop in evictions, then a steep rise in them about a year and a half later, then counts that are higher than at the beginning of 2020. But unless you had followed eviction trends and COVID relief policies, you might not know why any of those things occurred.\n\n\n\nFrom Abraham et al.

By which I mean a census tract is made up of a bunch of people (usually about 4,000) in a contiguous area who mostly live in households. But if you work with census data enough, you’ll know that some places have population but few households, or only very small populations altogether—a tract might actually be a jail or a set of college dorms, or maybe the majority of a tract is those sorts of group quarters, and the remainder is too small to reliably calculate some of the data.

    "section": "The wage gaps",
    "text": "The wage gaps\nSo we already established that Maryland has higher earnings, on average, than the US. Usually when people say “the wage gap,” they’re talking about women’s pay versus men’s pay, e.g. women make x cents on the dollar.1\n1 All of this analysis is based on Census data, which only records gender as male and female, so that’s what we’ve got to work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, super important point but doesn’t quite warrant a chart. You’d get a better sense of the comparison that’s more memorable by just writing:\n\n\nWorking women in Maryland make about 78 cents on the male dollar.\n\n\n(And then in the footnotes include the specifications of “among adults ages 25 and up with positive earnings in 2021.”)\nOne explanation often given for women’s pay being less is that women are more likely to work part-time, and part-time jobs pay much less on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now we’ve established that there are differences in median earnings between women and men, and between full-time and part-time workers, and that Maryland has a higher median earning than the US as a whole. One of the frameworks we’ll use for understanding our data is data feminism (D’Ignazio, 2015; D’Ignazio & Klein, 2020), which looks at how data can be used to highlight intersections between the patterns we’ve established.\n\nD’Ignazio, C. (2015). What would feminist data visualization look like? https://civic.mit.edu/feminist-data-visualization.html\n\nD’Ignazio, C., & Klein, L. F. (2020). Data feminism. The MIT Press. https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/\nA good place to start, then, is earnings by sex and full-time status. Let’s make a table:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Median individual earnings, adults ages 25+ with positive earnings by sex and full-time status, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nMen\nWomen\n\n\n\n\nFull-time\n$72,222\n$62,802\n\n\nPart-time\n$21,579\n$19,200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust kidding, that’s hard to get a pattern from, and we now have enough comparisons to warrant a chart:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gaps are actually smaller within groups (full-time men vs full-time women or part-time men vs part-time women) than across (all men vs all women). So the tendency of women to work part time explains some of the wage gap, but not all of it. If the difference were only about work status, we would expect to see no within-group gaps here.2\n2 We’ll talk about annotations in a couple weeks, and we’ll return to these charts to practice. Think about what you might want to annotate on these multidimensional charts.Wages by educational attainment aren’t surprising—higher educational attainment corresponds to higher incomes. This is just for adults working full-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might as well look at both education and sex. Let’s naively assume the pattern will be the same for men and women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among only full-time workers, there are gaps at every education level so severe that men at any given education level are paid roughly as much as women at the next level above them. For example, after getting a graduate degree and working full time, women only earn about $1,100 more than men with only a bachelor’s. That’s a pattern that would be hard to glean from just reading a table of numbers or from only seeing the within-groups ratios.\nHere’s a chart of those within-groups ratios that is technically fine but practically not very useful:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is more important to know, the gap within education levels, or the gap across education levels? Or both? What’s missing that makes this chart alone not very useful?\nSo far we’ve worked through identifying several important patterns using just a very simple type of chart that people commonly know how to read—the charts are almost identical, just different slices of the data. But other chart types might help with highlighting different things, such as those gaps.",
