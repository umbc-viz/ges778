    "text": "At its essence, the aim of data visualization is to move data and its meaning(s) and context(s) from some origin (spreadsheets, observed phenomena, etc.) to a larger audience. It’s a spectrum of incredibly powerful tools for not just understanding and explaining facts, but also for shaping what those facts are and creating the narrative around them. By the end of this course, you will have thought through your role and responsibility in an evolving field, developed a set of best practices that is likely to continue to change, engaged with larger social currents toward your own goals, and strengthened your skills in R.\nBecause this is part of a professional studies program based on open source software and the ethos behind it, the course will be very hands-on and require everyone’s willingness to contribute and participate. Instead of tests and graded homework assignments, we’ll focus on practice, critique, and revision, building continuously on individual projects and shared tools. To some extent, the class structure will mimic a workplace, where you have projects with checkpoints and meetings to brainstorm and workshop your ideas, with time to work both in class and on your own at home.\nBecause data science and data visualization—and the software we use for both—change so quickly, a lot of the community’s discourse happens in less formal settings, such as blogs, social media, podcasts, and workshops, rather than just traditional academic journals and books. Our readings (defined loosely enough to include videos of talks, podcasts, and simply browsing through data visualization projects) will likewise fall along this spectrum, and you’ll have some flexibility in what you read and share.\nAbove all, I want this to be a course that is useful to you as you build a career of critical engagement with data. The schedule is intentionally loose so we can adjust based on skills we may want or need to build upon, and each student’s goals and interests. Please be willing to share what you want to learn, contribute resources, and ask for what you need of me and each other.",

Readings will be a mix of theory and practice.\nThe schedule of the course will roughly follow the structure of the book Fundamentals of Data Visualization (Wilke 2019). Both the book and the source code used to write it are available for free online.\nWe’ll also read portions of R for Data Science (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund 2023) (also open source), How Charts Lie (Cairo 2019), and Data Points (Yau 2013), as well as a variety of other sources of different media. I’ll keep a running list of resources in the online class notes with other tutorials and references.\n\n\nSoftware\nThis is a rough set of the software and tools we will use, with open source software in italics:\n\nR programming language\nggplot2 and related packages\nRStudio or another integrated development environment\nQuarto, a markdown-based publishing system from the same team as RStudio\ngit for version control, GitHub for storage of version-controlled materials, and GitHub Classroom for discussions and submitting code\nBlackboard for assignments and announcements\n\nI’m open to suggestions on any other tools you all think would be useful.\n\n\nOther tools\nIf at all possible, you should have a laptop of your own for this class. All the software we’re using is free and open source, so you should be able to install everything on your computer. If you do not have a laptop, you can borrow one from the library, or, because we will be using git for version tracking and GitHub for storage, you can use a lab computer and make sure to upload your work regularly.\nWe’ll be doing a lot of sketching by hand (you don’t have to be good at drawing), so you’ll need a notebook and pens or pencils that are nice to doodle with. I highly, highly recommend finding a graph paper or dotted notebook.",

As a result, rather than tedious quizzes and problem sets, your grade will reflect the effort you put into developing your process and your critical eye, and how successfully you create compelling stories with data.\n\nParticipation\nThere will be opportunities for participation points every week, including:\n\nBringing in visualizations you’ve found for us to discuss\nOpening your work up for workshopping\nContributing code (there’s an R package in development for this class), with more points given for students with less experience in R—this includes the less glamorous but crucial tasks of testing, debugging, and documenting\nDoing an optional reading or attending a talk and reporting back to the class on some interesting things you learned\nAdding a resource to the class notes\n\nThere will be two opportunities to lose points as well:\n\nBeing mean or unnecessarily harsh in critique\nUnexcused absences (see below)\n\nThere’s no set number of participation points you need—just rack them up when you can, forgo them when you have to, and I’ll scale them at the end of the semester. Notice that most of these involve contributing to your classmates’ growth as well as your own.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be 2 projects, one midterm and one final, that you’ll be working on throughout the semester. Both will build upon the exercises, and you’ll have lots of time to work on them in class and receive feedback from myself and your peers. The first will be non-spatial data, and the second will be both spatial and non-spatial. You’ll be responsible for moving from a dataset through to a polished visualization that tells a story and has real-world impact. You will also document your process along the way and have check-ins regularly. Each project will also have a semi-formal write-up to explain what you did and why, and to situate your work into the theory and principles we study.\n\n\nOther assignments\nWe’ll have a few more small assignments, including short case studies and peer reviews.\n\n\nGrading scale\nGrades will be rounded to the nearest whole percent.\n\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n97% +\n\n\nA\n93-96%\n\n\nA-\n90-92%\n\n\nB+\n87-89%\n\n\nB\n83-86%\n\n\nB-\n80-82%\n\n\nC+\n77-79%\n\n\nC\n73-76%\n\n\nC-\n70-72%\n\n\nD+\n67-69%\n\n\nD\n63-66%\n\n\nD-\n60-62%\n\n\nF\n&lt; 60%\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade distribution\n\n\n\nCategory\nShare of grade\n\n\n\n\nCase studies\n15%\n\n\nPeer review & reflections\n5%\n\n\nParticipation\n20%\n\n\nProject 1 visualization\n20%\n\n\nProject 1 write-up\n5%\n\n\nProject 2 visualization\n25%\n\n\nProject 2 write-up\n10%",

The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate accommodations that creates equal access for students when barriers to participation exist in University courses, programs, or activities.\nIf you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations in your courses, please refer to the SDS website at sds.umbc.edu for registration information and office procedures.\nSDS email: disAbility@umbc.edu (disability at umbc dot edu)\nSDS phone: 410-455-2459\nIf you will be using SDS approved accommodations in this class, please contact the instructor to discuss implementation of the accommodations. During remote instruction requirements due to COVID, communication and flexibility will be essential for success.\n\n\nSexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Based Violence and Discrimination\nUMBC Policy in addition to federal and state law (to include Title IX) prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in University programs and activities. Any student who is impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, gender discrimination, pregnancy discrimination, gender-based harassment, or related retaliation should contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator to make a report and/or access support and resources. The Title IX Coordinator can be reached at titleixcoordinator at umbc dot edu or 410-455-1717.\nYou can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. You will not be forced to file a formal complaint or police report. Please be aware that the University may take action on its own if essential to protect the safety of the community.\nIf you are interested in making a report, please use the Online Reporting/Referral Form.  Please note that, if you report anonymously, the University’s ability to respond will be limited.\n\nNotice that Faculty and Teaching Assistants are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations\nAll faculty members and teaching assistants are considered Responsible Employees, per UMBC’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Discrimination. Faculty and teaching assistants therefore required to report all known information regarding alleged conduct that may be a violation of the Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, even if a student discloses an experience that occurred before attending UMBC and/or an incident that only involves people not affiliated with UMBC.  Reports are required regardless of the amount of detail provided and even in instances where support has already been offered or received.\nWhile faculty members want to encourage you to share information related to your life experiences through discussion and written work, students should understand that faculty are required to report past and present sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, and gender discrimination that is shared with them to the Title IX Coordinator so that the University can inform students of their rights, resources, and support.  While you are encouraged to do so, you are not obligated to respond to outreach conducted as a result of a report to the Title IX Coordinator.\nIf you need to speak with someone in confidence, who does not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator, UMBC has a number of Confidential Resources available to support you: \nRetriever Integrated Health (Main Campus): 410-455-2472; Monday – Friday 8:30 a.m. – 5 p.m.; For After-Hours Support, Call 988.\nCenter for Counseling and Well-Being (Shady Grove Campus): 301-738-6273; Monday-Thursday 10:00a.m. – 7:00 p.m. and Friday 10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m. (virtual) Online Appointment Request Form\nPastoral Counseling via The Gathering Space for Spiritual Well-Being: 410-455-6795; i3b at umbc dot edu; Monday – Friday 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m.\n\n\nOther Resources\nWomen’s Center (open to students of all genders): 410-455-2714; womenscenter at umbc dot edu; Monday – Thursday 9:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. and Friday 10:00 a.m. – 4 p.m.\nShady Grove Student Resources, Maryland Resources, National Resources.\n\n\nChild Abuse and Neglect\nPlease note that Maryland law and UMBC policy require that faculty report all disclosures or suspicions of child abuse or neglect to the Department of Social Services and_/_or the police even if the person who experienced the abuse or neglect is now over 18.\n\n\n\nPregnant and Parenting Students\nUMBC’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination expressly prohibits all forms of discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, including pregnancy. Resources for pregnant, parenting and breastfeeding students are available through the University’s Office of Equity and Civil Rights.  Pregnant and parenting students are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator to discuss plans and ensure ongoing access to their academic program with respect to a leave of absence – returning following leave, or any other accommodation that may be needed related to pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, breastfeeding, and/or the early months of parenting.\nIn addition, students who are pregnant and have an impairment related to their pregnancy that qualifies as disability under the ADA may be entitled to accommodations through the Office of Student Disability Services.\n\n\nReligious Observances & Accommodations\nUMBC Policy provides that students should not be penalized because of observances of their religious beliefs, and that students shall be given an opportunity, whenever feasible, to make up within a reasonable time any academic assignment that is missed due to individual participation in religious observances. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor of any intended absences or requested modifications for religious observances in advance, and as early as possible. For questions or guidance regarding religious observances and accommodations, please contact the Office of Equity and Civil Rights at ecr at umbc dot edu.\n\n\nHate, Bias, Discrimination and Harassment\nUMBC values safety, cultural and ethnic diversity, social responsibility, lifelong learning, equity, and civic engagement.\nConsistent with these principles, UMBC Policy prohibits discrimination and harassment in its educational programs and activities or with respect to employment terms and conditions based on race, creed, color, religion, sex, gender, pregnancy, ancestry, age, gender identity or expression, national origin, veterans status, marital status, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or genetic information.\nStudents (and faculty and staff) who experience discrimination, harassment, hate, or bias based upon a protected status or who have such matters reported to them should use the online reporting/referral form to report discrimination, hate, or bias incidents. You may report incidents that happen to you anonymously. Please note that, if you report anonymously, the University’s ability to respond may be limited.\n\n\nUMBC Writing Center\nThe Academic Success Center offers free writing assistance through our Writing Center, which is located on the first floor of the Library.

    "text": "Making a chart might seem like a pretty straightforward task: you have data, you make a chart. But there are a lot of things to consider, and they depend on all sorts of factors, like the type of data, your audience, your purpose in visualizing it, the context, and on and on.\nFirst question you should ask yourself:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThat chart is fine, but it takes up a lot of space to only show 2 numbers. Oftentimes projects that require visualization have caps on length, such as grant applications or print reports where every additional page adds to the budget. In a lot of contexts, you’re probably better off with written text, either just a written sentence if it’s for a report or article, or bullet points or a pull-out quote. You’ll often see documents with something formatted like this:\n\n\nMaryland adults ages 25 and up had median earnings of about $55,000 in 2022, more than $11,000 higher than the US average.\n\n\nMaybe you have a lot of data and your audience wants to see every number exactly, or you just have 2 or 3 numbers but you’re short on space: a nicely formatted table might be better.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Median individual earnings, adults ages 25+ with positive earnings, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nMedian earnings\n\n\n\n\nUS\n$43,961\n\n\nMaryland\n$55,108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you have somewhere in between a couple data points and too many data points, then making a chart could work. So we’re gonna make a lot of charts.\nIn fact, this data gets at a super pet peeve of mine that can be illustrated well with data visualization.\n\n\n\nSo we already established that Maryland has higher earnings, on average, than the US. Usually when people say “the wage gap,” they’re talking about women’s pay versus men’s pay, e.g. women make x cents on the dollar.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, super important point but doesn’t quite warrant a chart. You’d get a better sense of the comparison that’s more memorable by just writing:\n\n\nWorking women in Maryland make about 78 cents on the male dollar.\n\n\n(And then in the footnotes include the specifications of “among adults ages 25 and up with positive earnings in 2022.”)\nOne explanation often given for women’s pay being less is that women are more likely to work part-time, and part-time jobs pay much less on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now we’ve established that there are differences in median earnings between women and men, and between full-time and part-time workers, and that Maryland has a higher median earning than the US as a whole. One of the frameworks we’ll use for understanding our data is data feminism (D’Ignazio 2015; D’Ignazio and Klein 2020), which looks at how data can be used to highlight intersections between the patterns we’ve established.\nA good place to start, then, is earnings by sex and full-time status. Let’s make a table:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Median individual earnings, adults ages 25+ with positive earnings by sex and full-time status, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nMen\nWomen\n\n\n\n\nFull-time\n$72,222\n$62,802\n\n\nPart-time\n$21,579\n$19,200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust kidding, that’s hard to get a pattern from, and we now have enough comparisons to warrant a chart:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gaps are actually smaller within groups (full-time men vs full-time women or part-time men vs part-time women) than across (all men vs all women). So the tendency of women to work part time explains some of the wage gap, but not all of it. If the difference were only about work status, we would expect to see no within-group gaps here.2\nWe’ve also looked at education, so we might as well look at both education and sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among only full-time workers, there are gaps at every education level so severe that men at any given education level are paid roughly as much as women at the next level above them. For example, after getting a graduate degree and working full time, women only earn about $1,100 more than men with only a bachelor’s. That’s a pattern that would be hard to glean from just reading a table of numbers or from only seeing the within-groups ratios.\nSo far we’ve worked through identifying several important patterns using just a very simple type of chart that people commonly know how to read—the charts are almost identical, just different slices of the data. But other chart types might help with highlighting different things, such as those gaps.\n\n\n\n\nRevise the code to break down values by race/ethnicity and sex instead of education and sex (i.e. filter for dimension == \"race\" and dimension == \"race_x_sex\" instead of education.)\nBrowse through the Data Visualisation Catalogue (Ribecca 2024) and see if you find any other chart types that would be appropriate for visualizing the sex and education chart (Figure 5). Which chart types would be better, especially for highlighting the gaps or exploring other aspects of the story?\nFollowing question 2, Wilke gives a brief example in section 6.3 of switching from bar charts to dot plots; how could this be adapted here?",

That’s a pattern that would be hard to glean from just reading a table of numbers or from only seeing the within-groups ratios.\nSo far we’ve worked through identifying several important patterns using just a very simple type of chart that people commonly know how to read—the charts are almost identical, just different slices of the data. But other chart types might help with highlighting different things, such as those gaps.",
