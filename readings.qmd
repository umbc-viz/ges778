Here are the readings for each week. Please have the readings done _before_ the corresponding class. I'll try not to assign too much reading, so please come ready to discuss! 

(Please also don't make me regret saying this but in case you absolutely can't get all the reading done, they're in order of importance so start at the top each week.)


## Week 2, Feb 7: encoding data to visuals; making meaning of data

* @Wilke2019 chapters 2 & 3
* @Cairo2019 intro (on Blackboard)
* Pick one (or both. They're both great, but if you only choose one I'd go with the podcast.):
  * Read @DIgnazio2015
  * Listen to PolicyViz, @Schwabish2018

## Week 3, Feb 14: writing good code; color
