# Learning about your data

```{r}
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(justviz)
library(ggtext)

source(here::here("utils/plotting_utils.R"))

```

How you visualize data depends on what data you have. A lot of the worst data visualizations come from people not understanding what types of data they have and what they can do with it. 

For example, with the bar chart of median earnings by sex and education, would it have been okay to display the data like this?

```{r}
wages |>
  filter(dimension == "sex_x_edu",
         name == "Maryland")
```
