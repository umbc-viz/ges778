## What is data visualization?

A few definitions of data visualization:

> The rendering of information in a visual format to help communicate data while also generating new patterns and knowledge through the act of visualization itself [@D.B.R2018 p. 8]

> The representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding [@Kirk2016 p. 19]

It's pretty common to find a book with hundreds of pages of details on data visualization, but no definition. 

What else could we add here?

## What should visualization do?

> Data visualization is part art and part science. The challenge is to get the art right without getting the science wrong and vice versa. A data visualization first and foremost has to accurately convey the data. It must not mislead or distort.... At the same time, a data visualization should be aesthetically pleasing [@Wilke2019 ch 1]
