We've all heard that a picture is worth a thousand words, but what if we don't understand what we're looking at? Social media has made charts, infographics, and diagrams ubiquitous--and easier to share than ever. While such visualizations can better inform us, they can also deceive by displaying incomplete or inaccurate data, suggesting misleading patterns-- or simply misinform us by being poorly designed, such as the confusing "eye of the storm" maps shown on TV every hurricane season. Many of us are ill equipped to interpret the visuals that politicians, journalists, advertisers, and even employers present each day, enabling bad actors to easily manipulate visuals to promote their own agendas. Public conversations are increasingly driven by numbers, and to make sense of them we must be able to decode and use visual information.

We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels{\textemdash}the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity{\textemdash}and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.},

Eligible studies included original peer-reviewed research published from 1980 to December 2020, with a participant population of Black youth, a focus on police exposure, and health as the outcome. Additional articles were identified by hand-searching reference lists of included studies. Data extraction was performed, followed by critical appraisal of all included studies using a convergent segregated approach in which quantitative and qualitative studies were synthesized separately followed by an overarching synthesis across methods.A total of 16 quantitative studies including 19\,493 participants were included in the review and demonstrated an association between police exposure and adverse mental health, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use. A total of 13 qualitative studies including 461 participants were included in the review, which corroborated and contextualized the quantitative evidence and provided additional health outcomes, such as fear for life or hopelessness.Evidence shows that police exposures are associated with adverse health outcomes for Black youth.

This book details essential strategies to create more effective data visualizations. Jonathan Schwabish walks readers through the steps of creating better graphs and how to move beyond simple line, bar, and pie charts. Through more than five hundred examples, he demonstrates the do's and don'ts of data visualization, the principles of visual perception, and how to make subjective style decisions around a chart's design. Schwabish surveys more than eighty visualization types, from histograms to horizon charts, ridgeline plots to choropleth maps, and explains how each has its place in the visual toolkit. It might seem intimidating, but everyone can learn how to create compelling, effective data visualizations.

  abstract = {The benefits of digital soil maps cannot be overemphasised. For many years, researchers have mapped different soil classes, properties and processes while identifying the spatial associations between soil properties using side-by-side visualization maps. Although this is acceptable, it may be difficult to identify complex spatial associations between the mapped soil properties. For some, the task may be challenging owing to multiple times of side-by-side placing of the maps and the possible application of none user-friendly colour palettes and or schemes. Innovative tools are proposed for visualizing and identifying spatial associations between digital soil maps (raster layers) using bivariate and trivariate maps. These tools are applied in a case study to identify the spatial interactions between pH and selected macro-nutrients [nitrogen (N) and potassium (K)] of similar locality (Czech Republic), resolution and scale. This study further gives a brief overview of the applicability of bivariate and trivariate maps following the digital soil mapping process. Results show that bivariate and trivariate maps are effective for visualizing complex associations between pH and macro-nutrients. However, precautionary measures should be taken while applying bivariate and trivariate maps to ensure they are self-explanatory and that the legend colour schemes applied are user-friendly. Also, the variables mapped should be related. In this case, pH is a key soil quality indicator that affects macro-nutrient availability in soils.},

In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index ( ), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index ( ), a spatial relative diversity index ( ), and a spatial dissimilarity index ( ). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index *{\textemdash}which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments{\textemdash}and the spatial information theory index {\textemdash}which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual{\textemdash}are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

In two preregistered studies (conducted in the fall of 2020), we examined whether perceptions of COVID-19 racial disparities predict White U.S. residents' attitudes toward COVID-19. Utilizing a correlational design (N~=~498), we found that those who perceived COVID-19 racial disparities to be greater reported reduced fear of COVID-19, which predicted reduced support for COVID-19 safety precautions. In Study 2, we manipulated exposure to information about COVID-19 racial disparities (N~=~1,505). Reading about the persistent inequalities that produced COVID-19 racial disparities reduced fear of COVID-19, empathy for those vulnerable to COVID-19, and support for safety precautions. These findings suggest that publicizing racial health disparities has the potential to create a vicious cycle wherein raising awareness reduces support for the very policies that could protect public health and reduce disparities.},
